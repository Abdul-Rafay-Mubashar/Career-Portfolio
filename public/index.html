            <p>
              In spearheading the development of Tapp Event Solutions, my
              technical contributions were multifaceted and instrumental in
              meeting the client's objectives. The careful selection of
              technologies was foundational to the project's success, with React
              JS and Next JS chosen for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and
              adaptable user interface. Additionally, the incorporation of
              Electron JS extended the application's reach across various
              platforms, accommodating both web and mobile users seamlessly. On
              the backend, Ruby on Rails was employed for its efficiency and
              convention-over-configuration principles. This facilitated rapid
              development, maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. Devise
              auth was integrated for secure user authentication, laying the
              groundwork for personalized user experiences and robust permission
              management. The implementation of a credit-based system, a core
              feature of Tapp, demanded a nuanced understanding of financial
              transactions. Integration with popular payment gateways and the
              use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) bolstered the development of a secure
              and efficient credit system, contributing significantly to the
              platform's functionality. Real-time communication, a crucial
              aspect for user engagement during events, was achieved through the
              integration of WebSockets. This facilitated the prompt delivery of
              notifications, keeping users informed about their orders and
              pertinent event updates. Testing and quality assurance were
              prioritized through Test Driven Development (TDD) practices,
              employing tools like React Testing Library, Capybara, Cypress, and
              Jest. This meticulous approach ensured the reliability and
              bug-free performance of every component within the system. To
              cater to a global audience, internationalization (i18n) and
              localization (l10n) features were implemented. This strategic move
              enhanced the platform's accessibility by adapting it to diverse
              languages and cultural contexts. The integration of OAuth,
              JSON:API, and RESTful APIs was seamlessly executed, fostering
              interoperability with third-party services. This not only expanded
              the platform's functionality but also enriched the user experience
              by incorporating additional services. Continuous
              Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines were
              established to automate testing and deployment processes,
              optimizing development efficiency and ensuring smooth rollouts of
              updates and new features. In summary, my technical prowess played
              a pivotal role in the end-to-end development of Tapp Event
              Solutions, delivering a scalable, secure, and user-friendly
              platform that met and exceeded the client's expectations in the
              dynamic landscape of modern event management.

              I took on the challenge of completely redesigning and rebuilding
              the Augersoft website using the MERN stack, effectively
              revitalizing their online presence with a modern, user-friendly
              experience that highlights their expertise in cutting-edge
              technologies and mobile solutions. I seamlessly integrated
              React.js to create a dynamic and engaging interface, coupled with
              Node.js for efficient server-side scripting and API development,
              and MongoDB for effortless data management. I navigated the
              complexities of presenting diverse technical information in a
              clear and accessible way, while also crafting a UI that caters to
              both technical and non-technical audiences. The resulting
              responsive design adapts flawlessly across devices, leading to
              increased website traffic, user engagement, and lead generation.
              This project serves as a powerful demonstration of my ability to
              leverage full-stack development with the MERN stack to construct
              impactful web applications.

              Our German site Car Scraper robust data extraction solution
              designed to collect detailed automobile information from German
              car platforms. The system operates in two phases to ensure
              comprehensive coverage: API-Based Scraping – The scraper connects
              directly to the platform’s API, retrieving structured vehicle data
              efficiently and accurately. Website Scraping – Using specific
              search parameters, the scraper navigates the site to extract
              additional listings and details not fully exposed through the API.
              This two-phase approach guarantees high data completeness,
              combining the speed of API access with the depth of web scraping.
              The results are processed, structured, and stored for easy
              analysis or integration into CSV file.

              Our Medical Request Automation System streamlines the process of
              handling patient requests by integrating AI-based CAPTCHA solving
              with intelligent task automation. The system automatically logs
              into the portal, processes image-based numeric CAPTCHAs through an
              AI model, and seamlessly navigates to the request management
              section. When a new request is added, the platform triggers an
              email notification to the assigned doctor, ensuring real-time
              updates and eliminating delays. This reduces manual effort,
              minimizes errors, and enhances workflow efficiency. By combining
              AI-driven image recognition, task automation, and email
              integration, the system ensures secure, reliable, and scalable
              performance. Designed for healthcare environments, it optimizes
              request handling, improves communication between patients and
              doctors, and significantly accelerates response times.
